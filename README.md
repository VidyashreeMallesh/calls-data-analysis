# Calls Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing 911 call data to extract meaningful insights and patterns. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to understand the distribution, trends, and potential factors influencing emergency calls.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
* **Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for data analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure

`911 Calls Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.

## Data Source

'911.csv' is the data used in this project is a dataset of 911 calls. The data contains information about 911 calls.

## Analysis Steps

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
    * Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
    * Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Explored the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
    * Analyzed the distribution of calls by various categories (e.g., reason, location, time).
3.  **Data Visualization:**
    * Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and trends.
    * Visualized the frequency of calls by time, location, and reason.
4.  **Insight Extraction:**
    * Extracted meaningful insights from the data and visualizations.
    * Identified key factors influencing 911 call patterns.

## Key Findings

* The most common reason for 911 calls is traffic incidents.
* Certain locations experience higher call volumes during specific times of day.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook) installed.
2.  Download or clone this repository.
3.  Open the `911 Calls Data Analysis.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
4.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
